# CHANGELOG

## v0.67u-3 Formation Guide Card Compact Info Polish
- Hid `UnitCloseupPanel` while preserving its node structure for later reuse.
- Reworked ally/enemy formation guide cards into compact portrait / name / troop / troop-icon / troop-type layout.
- Removed card status text and kept active/reserve distinction through visual styling only.
- Reduced guide-card text sizes for a tighter strategy UI read.
- Reused existing token textures and hero visual fallback data for troop icon rendering.
- No battle logic change intended.

## v0.67u Formation Slot Guide Layout MVP
- Hid/deprecated the large legacy `LeftPanel` and `RightPanel` info panels.
- Added `BattleMiniLogPanel`.
- Added ally/enemy formation slot guide panels for main `3` + reinforce `2` per side.
- Kept the guide display-only with no click behavior and no battle logic changes.

## v0.67t-hotfix Bottom Command TextureButton Scene Fix
- Converted the 3 bottom command buttons from `Button` to scene-authored `TextureButton`.
- Connected the 6 PNG assets directly in `Battle_Fullscreen_Test.tscn`.
- Restored bottom command button visibility in the Godot 2D editor.
- Kept existing handlers unchanged and kept `RetreatButton` as a disabled placeholder.

## v0.67t Bottom Command Button PNG Apply QA
- Applied the 6 real bottom-command PNG files to the bottom global command bar.
- Kept `AutoBattleButton`, `EndTurnButton`, and `RetreatButton` as existing `Button` nodes with existing handlers unchanged.
- `RetreatButton` remains a disabled placeholder.
- Button text is cleared only when image style apply succeeds, so text overlap is avoided without breaking fallback behavior.

## v0.67s Bottom Command Button Actual Asset Integration
- Added safe bottom-command art helpers for real optional PNG loading.
- Kept `Button` nodes and existing handlers unchanged.
- Missing PNG files remain a safe fallback path with no intended behavior change.

## v0.67r Bottom Command Bar Art Asset Structure Prep
- Prepared `assets/web_battle/ui/bottom_command/README.md` and the planned button PNG naming structure.
- Kept `AutoBattleButton`, `EndTurnButton`, and `RetreatButton` as existing `Button` nodes.
- Reused existing handlers with no intended behavior change.
- Added optional bottom-command art mapping in runtime code.
- If the PNG files are absent, the project keeps current button behavior and avoids load errors.

## v0.67-docs Agent Docs Slimdown
- Slimmed top-level `agent` docs for faster Codex session startup and wrap-up.
- Preserved full pre-slimdown history in:
  - `agent/archive/v0.67-docs_agent_docs_slimdown/CURRENT_STATE_full_before_slimdown.md`
  - `agent/archive/v0.67-docs_agent_docs_slimdown/CHANGELOG_full_before_slimdown.md`
  - `agent/archive/v0.67-docs_agent_docs_slimdown/SESSION_LOG_full_before_slimdown.md`
- Rebased top-level operational docs on the current stable baseline `v0.67p-3-hotfix3 Active Ally Pulse Pivot Lock QA Stable`.

## v0.67p-3-hotfix3 Active Ally Pulse Pivot Lock QA Stable
- Stable baseline locked around unified root active-ally pulse with pivot lock and clean restore.
- Floating command panel remains hidden at ally turn start, opens on active ally click, and auto-reopens after movement + facing completion.
- Direct move-click UX, floating panel behavior, bottom command bar, reinforcement toast, result toast, and `5v5` result path remain stable.
- `GDScript` warning count expected `0`.

## v0.67p-1 to v0.67p-3 UX Summary
- Bottom command bar simplified to global commands.
- Floating command panel added and stabilized as the active ally command surface.
- Direct move-click was restored and stabilized.
- Floating panel opacity/layer priority were stabilized.
- Active ally pulse replaced ally-turn-start auto-open as the primary active-unit emphasis.
- Post-move floating panel auto-reopen was stabilized.

## v0.67m-1 Result Toast Tuning Summary
- Victory / defeat result toast scale and hold duration were increased on the shared battle toast queue.
- Reinforcement toast and round-start toast behavior remained stable.

## v0.67k-5 Enemy AI Multi-Target Engagement Fix Summary
- Enemy AI reservation and fallback-target planning were improved for multi-target battles.
- Rear / distant enemies can now continue engagement planning instead of passively idling in the validated smoke path.
- This is completed stable history, not the current active task.

## Older History
- Older detailed history is archived at `agent/archive/v0.67-docs_agent_docs_slimdown/CHANGELOG_full_before_slimdown.md`.
