# CHANGELOG

## v0.67-docs Agent Docs Slimdown
- Slimmed top-level `agent` docs for faster Codex session startup and wrap-up.
- Preserved full pre-slimdown history in:
  - `agent/archive/v0.67-docs_agent_docs_slimdown/CURRENT_STATE_full_before_slimdown.md`
  - `agent/archive/v0.67-docs_agent_docs_slimdown/CHANGELOG_full_before_slimdown.md`
  - `agent/archive/v0.67-docs_agent_docs_slimdown/SESSION_LOG_full_before_slimdown.md`
- Rebased top-level operational docs on the current stable baseline `v0.67p-3-hotfix3 Active Ally Pulse Pivot Lock QA Stable`.

## v0.67p-3-hotfix3 Active Ally Pulse Pivot Lock QA Stable
- Stable baseline locked around unified root active-ally pulse with pivot lock and clean restore.
- Floating command panel remains hidden at ally turn start, opens on active ally click, and auto-reopens after movement + facing completion.
- Direct move-click UX, floating panel behavior, bottom command bar, reinforcement toast, result toast, and `5v5` result path remain stable.
- `GDScript` warning count expected `0`.

## v0.67p-1 to v0.67p-3 UX Summary
- Bottom command bar simplified to global commands.
- Floating command panel added and stabilized as the active ally command surface.
- Direct move-click was restored and stabilized.
- Floating panel opacity/layer priority were stabilized.
- Active ally pulse replaced ally-turn-start auto-open as the primary active-unit emphasis.
- Post-move floating panel auto-reopen was stabilized.

## v0.67m-1 Result Toast Tuning Summary
- Victory / defeat result toast scale and hold duration were increased on the shared battle toast queue.
- Reinforcement toast and round-start toast behavior remained stable.

## v0.67k-5 Enemy AI Multi-Target Engagement Fix Summary
- Enemy AI reservation and fallback-target planning were improved for multi-target battles.
- Rear / distant enemies can now continue engagement planning instead of passively idling in the validated smoke path.
- This is completed stable history, not the current active task.

## Older History
- Older detailed history is archived at `agent/archive/v0.67-docs_agent_docs_slimdown/CHANGELOG_full_before_slimdown.md`.
