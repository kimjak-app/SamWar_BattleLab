## Completed / Archived Context
- `v0.67w Battle Screen Basic UX Stable Lock` is complete.
- Locked the current MVP battle-screen UX around:
  - ally formation guide `5` cards
  - enemy formation guide `5` cards
  - lower-left battle mini log
  - bottom command `TextureButton` bar + background panel
  - floating command panel
- Kept legacy large side panels hidden, kept `UnitCloseupPanel` hidden, and kept direct move-click / rollback / post-move reopen / active ally pulse stable.
- Bottom command bar background is considered good enough for MVP and can remain a later polish candidate.
